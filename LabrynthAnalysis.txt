Ran on N = 1,000,000

Output:

Total Number of Labrynth Visits: 28720485 for 1000000 people in 10985 ms.

I had some issues with this problem statement.

1. It doesn't specify whether guests can bring anything into the maze with them or is the cupcakes have wrappers. I assumed they had wrappers.
2. It doesn't specify whether all guests must report to the minotaur or if only one guest has to. I assume that all guests must report and they don't need to do it all at once.

With these assumptions in mind, I created the following solution:

1. The minotaur randomly chooses a guest to enter the maze (the minotaur knows who he's picking next)
2. The current visitor enters the maze. If it's their first time, they eat the cupcake and leave the wrapper.
3. If the current visitor notices N wrappers on the ground, they tell the minotaur that everyone has visited.

The use of a synchronized method ensures only one guest can visit the labrynth at once.
